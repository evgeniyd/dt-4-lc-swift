# Problem

Heap is the data structure that I often has to drop into my Leetcode solutions. I implemented `MinHeap` and `MaxHeap` for educational purpose from scratch once, and started using it for Leetcode problems. This project exists so can quickly copy-and-paste a Heap to my Swift Leetcode solutions.

# Goals

1. Simple AF
2. Tested
3. Compact / Obfuscated (Less lines of code)

# TODO

- [x] Add test to `MinHeap`
- [ ] Add tests to `MaxHeap`
- [ ] Script to obfuscate `MinHeap`
- [ ] Script to obfuscate `MaxHeap`
- [ ] Move code comments to the documentation
- [ ] Add performance tests
